# CardsWar_game


### A simple project I made to practice on python.
<br>

#### I made a file contain the game solution in oop, to try to improve my skills on it, 
#### and the roles was:
<ul>
<li>two playres, user and computer.</li>
<li>the deck is divided evenly, each player recive 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down.</li>
<li> each players places his stack of cards face down in front of him.</li>
<br>
<li>each player turnes up a card at the same time, and the player with the higher card take both cards, and but them face down on the buttom of his stack.</li>
<li>if the card are the same, it's <strong>war.</strong></li>
<br>
<li>in war situation: each player turns up three cards face down and one card face up. </li>
<li>the player with higher card takes both piles. (six cards)</li>
<li>if the turned up cards are the same, it's war again.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>

#### And I made another file contain the game solution in functions and with <u>different roles</u> that I saw online.
